# Capture The Real Flag (CTRF) walkthrough, a journey of fun and excitement

## EHAX’s CTRF Captured Day 0 of Invictus!

In the first edition of CTRF, we successfully popularized CTRF in a more gamified way as a treasure hunt, attracting massive participation. Our volunteers were kept busy for the entire three-hour event. Both the team and the participants thoroughly enjoyed the experience, making our event a huge success.

## What is CTRF?

CTRF stands for Capture the Real Flags. Similar to a treasure hunt, it consists of both intuition-based and technical questions. By solving them, participants reach a specific location, which serves as the flag. The challenges were designed to be inclusive, allowing both technical and non-technical participants to compete without the constraint of being a DTU student with insider knowledge.

For our event, there were 9 clues leading to different locations within DTU campus, where volunteers provided the next clue upon validating all the previous chits. Once all 9 clues were collected, participants were directed to the final location—the BR Ambedkar Auditorium of DTU—where they attended the prize-giving ceremony after the formal inauguration of Invictus 2025. The first clue was randomized, while the remaining ones were given dynamically by volunteers based on the team’s progress. The event was held offline on February 15 at DTU, running from 11 AM to 2 PM.

## Stats

## Clues During the Hunt

There are in total 9 clues in the hunt, given in a unique order for each team

- **"ehax loves to dance and post it on Insta"** – Solve the Dancing Man Cipher using a reel caption featuring four volunteers posing. *(FLAG Point)*
- **"iAvgWZ8V"** – Use Pastebin (hinted in the clue sheet) to obtain a drive link containing a mathematical problem. Solving it provides coordinates to input into Google Maps, leading to the location. *(Avahan Mural at Sports Complex)*
- **"Smile, you’re on camera. The ship is sinking."** – Reach Titanic Point (*EE Dept*), click a smiling picture at the given number on the poster (*Stavya*), and a volunteer will approach. *(Electric Department entry point through OAT)*
- **"uggc://punyy.runk.grpu:9001/"** – Apply ROT13 to decrypt Caesar’s cipher, giving link to a website whose source code when seen HTML source code reveals a Japnese text which when transalted gives "Waku Waku" which is famous line of `Anya` - a anime character [SpyX Family] behind the water tank near *DOD*. *(Anya on wall at the DOD Water Tank)*

- **"He’s got nobody to talk to… must be a Discord bot."** – The Discord link given in CTRF rulebook . *(HIMS Chocolate Guy)*
- **"Go to the closed canteen and find the flag."** – A QR code at the location leads to a Google Meet link. Track the runner to get twaku waku imghe next clue.
- **"I wonder how Anonimbus promoted this event."** – Check the CTRF Promo Reel. *(Basketball Court)*
- **"Tune into 101000000Hz."** – Using a radio antenna while roaming the campus, participants receive a clear signal saying "Baw Baw." *Stavya* listens and provides the next clue. *(Pragya Bhawan)*
- **"Free if more than 1800''"** – Deciphering it reveals "30 minutes," referencing Domino’s tagline—"Delivery in 30 minutes or free." *(Raj Soin)*

- **CTRF Reel:** Tarush plays Valorant on his laptop with other EHAX members. After they leave, he finds himself alone. At the door, he discovers a chit instructing him to go to the Basketball Court, which itself is a hint. There, he finds "Welcome to EHAX CTRF," marking the official event details. **[Watch here](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DGAv07ZJrur/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==)**

- **Second Reel:** A fun promotional video featuring the line, "Don’t fall for Red Flags, capture the real flags," offering a playful take on CTRF. **[Watch here](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DF-V-Bzp7OT/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==)**

- **CTRF Dancing Reel:** Four EHAX members pose differently at each interval in front of DTU's flag area, with tilts of their poses. Subway Surfer music plays in the background, and the caption asks, "Is this a hint??" This is a Dancing Man Cipher that deciphers to "FLAG" for the first clue, though the reel itself reveals the location without decoding. **[Watch here](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DGELDRrT3Vu/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==)**
